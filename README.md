# html-css-project-omnifood

I completed the **Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS** course on Udemy, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann where I worked on a hands-on project called **Omnifood**. This project allowed me to apply all the HTML and CSS skills I learned throughout the course to build a fully responsive, real-world frontend page. By implementing layout structures, styling techniques, and responsive design principles, I developed a professional-quality site, reinforcing my knowledge and enabling me to efficiently create effective frontend pages.
